This project is intended to simulate the pocket computer used in the Windows operating system. Once the operation is introduced, it takes it over and calculates from left to right, 2 operands, regardless of the operators.
For example, if we have the operation: 2 + 3 * 5-1 / 3, the result will be 8.
